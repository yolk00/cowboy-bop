# Cowboy Bebop Db (CBDb)

This is a fun R&D project made with the purpose to practice web layouts as well as RESTful APIs.

Layouts are inspired by both [Line Animation Studio](https://thelinestudio.com/work/cowboy-bebop) for the Home page, and [Sturdy](https://sturdy.co/) for the Session(s) page(s).

## Things to fix

- Session - header font size responsiveness
- Home page video optimization (Mux? Blob?)
- Remove credits page
- Info - remove "Downloads" header (?)
- Session - fix display for staff with multiple positions (?)

## Todo

- Session - add buttons for prev / next episode
- Sessions - scroll to top visibility animation

## Future plans

- Gallery lightbox
- Music player (?)
